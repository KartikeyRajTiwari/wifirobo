# wifi-robo
A robot that takes instructions form android phone on wifi lan.
This project is a combination of app & hardware.This can work for multipurpose carrier bots/stress remover toy-bots/
as wll as a war robot.
FOLLOWING ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IT
1-Just load the app in an androidd phone.
2-Upload the code to the microcontroller.
3-Connect the phone to same wifi which microcontroller is connected.
4 Make connections using relay (take hints from the comments in code&images attached).

Using the code given for arduino/nodemcu/esp8266 we can make the microcontroller take instructions from an
android device on a personal local area network. 
Note that- This project's hardware is based on RELAY SWITCHES and thus active low connections are required
thus the code as it is will support RELAY SWITCH based robot.
In case if we wanna make a small robo compaion then also the code and the app may be used-just by negating the HIGH & LOW 
instructions in the microcontroller code.
